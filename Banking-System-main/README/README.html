        <h1>Project Documentation</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>
            This project consists of a simple banking application that allows
            users to log in, view their checking and savings account balances,
            make deposits, transfer funds, and explore a placeholder page for
            future crypto investments. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, with Firebase as the backend database.
        </p>

        <h2>File Structure</h2>

        <h3>index.html</h3>

        <p>
            The <code>index.html</code> file is the login and registration page
            for the application. Users can enter their username and password to
            log in or register for a new account. Upon successful login, users
            are redirected to the <code>welcome.html</code> page.
        </p>

        <h3>welcome.html</h3>

        <p>
            The <code>welcome.html</code> file is the main page that displays
            the user's financial information. It shows checking and savings
            account balances, provides buttons to make deposits and transfer
            funds, and offers a link to the <code>crypto.html</code> page. All
            the buttons are designed to toggle visibility of their respective
            input fields.
        </p>

        <h3>crypto.html</h3>

        <p>
            The <code>crypto.html</code> file is a placeholder page for future
            implementation of crypto investments. The contents of this page
            should be discussed with the professor or other students to fulfill
            the crypto investment requirement in the assignment document.
        </p>

        <h3>login.js</h3>

        <p>
            The <code>login.js</code> file handles user authentication and
            registration. It interacts with the Firebase database to store user
            information, such as username and password. It is important to note
            that you need to change the location of the JSON file in the
            argument of the
            <code>const serviceAccount = require()</code> function on line 8 to
            match your local machine.
        </p>

        <h3>bank_account_script.js</h3>

        <p>
            The <code>bank_account_script.js</code> file contains the
            functionality for updating the checking and savings balances
            displayed on the <code>welcome.html</code> page. It interacts with
            the Firebase database to store and retrieve the user's financial
            information in real-time.
        </p>

        <h2>Firebase Database Setup</h2>

        <p>
            The Firebase database is set up with two collections:
            <code>users</code> and <code>financial</code>. The
            <code>users</code> collection stores the username and password of
            each registered user. The <code>financial</code> collection stores
            the checking and savings account balances of each user, with the
            document ID matching the corresponding user document ID.
        </p>

        <h2>Testing Functionality</h2>

        <p>
            To test the functionality of the website from start to finish,
            follow these steps:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Start the application by running <code>login.js</code>.</li>
            <li>
                Open a browser and navigate to the login page (usually at
                <code>localhost:4000</code>).
            </li>
            <li>Register a new user or log in with an existing account.</li>
            <li>
                Once logged in, you will be redirected to the
                <code>welcome.html</code> page.
            </li>
            <li>Test the deposit, transfer funds, and crypto investment</li>
            <li>
                Check the Firebase database to ensure that the financial
                information is being updated in real-time.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Remaining Tasks</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Implement the <code>crypto.html</code> file and any necessary
                JavaScript functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
                If time permits, improve the design and appearance of the
                website.
            </li>
            <li>Figure out how to host the app using Firebase.</li>
            <li>
                Create your own individual home page with your resume, as
                instructed by the professor.
            </li>
        </ol>
